<H1 CLASS="western">Artemis Galaxy:</H1>
<P>&ldquo;<I><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The Torgoth are coming in
from the east. The Krailens from the north. I could destroy the enemy
fleets with a volley of nukes, but is this sector worth it? The USFP
forces to the west might need those very nukes to defend their
outpost. Will this sector's resources be worth the ammunition used to
capture it?&rdquo; -Captains log, U.S.F. Crow, Sector C-7 in the Echo
Quadrant.</FONT></I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What is it?</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Artemis-Galaxy is a strategy RPG
&ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; around the Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator
written by Thom Robertson. It's purpose is to create an environment
that allows for larger scale Artemis campaigns where multiple bridge
crews can work together against a common goal &ndash; liberating an
entire quadrant from enemy hands.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How does it work?</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">AG works by arranging multiple
Artemis maps onto a grid, and then tracking traits (such as who
&ldquo;owns&rdquo; the sector, how many Torgoth are currently there,
etc...). The AG &ldquo;engine&rdquo; would adjust those numbers as
crews complete missions in those sectors. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Crews play sectors by clicking on a
grid-sector on a larger map. When the captain decides that they want
to play that sector, AG would take a base mission XML file, add in
enemy fleets and friendly stations based on the current state of that
sector (and neighboring sectors!), and present it to the captain as a
downloadable zip. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The crew plays through the mission,
protecting their stations or conquering enemy territory. The mission
log gets generated as they play, and the captain submits this mission
log back into the AG website. The mission log provides information
such as how many nukes fired, enemies destroyed, and if the crew was
destroyed. The sector, and surrounding sectors, are then all updated
to reflect the result of that mission. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Multiple bridge crews could play in
a single campaign map, and would have to work together to attack or
defend strategically important sectors. They would also have to keep
an eye on ammunition consumption. Ship losses become problematic as
there are only so many resources to go around, and a crew might want
to retreat from a sector instead of risking the loss of an expensive
battleship. </FONT>

<H4 CLASS="western">Additional Concepts / Features:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Sector Capturing:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
	Sectors can only be captured if there is a USFP sector adjacent, and
	there is no obstacle impeding your travel to that sector (see
	below).</SPAN></FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Sector Barriers: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Certain
	sectors can only be captured from specific directions</SPAN>. This
	allows grand-scale natural obstacle, such as giant asteroid fields
	that protect a sector from a certain side. </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Sector Difficulty: </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Sectors
	vary in difficulty. A sector that has a high economic or tactical
	value might be very hard to take, with the enemy fleet directing
	lots of carriers to it. Other sectors might be more desolate, and
	have very little in the way of enemy resistance. </SPAN></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Turn Based:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
	The map updates on a turn basis. Currently I am thinking each turn
	is a week in real time, allowing weekend crews to play without
	needing to disrupt the work week to defend a sector from attack. </SPAN></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Sector production:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
	Sectors only produce so many resources per &ldquo;turn&rdquo;.
	Sectors owned by enemy fleets produce more ships per turn. Sectors
	owned by the USFP generate ammunition and Ship-Points (S.P. To be
	used to replace lost ships.)</SPAN></FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Sector Reinforcement:
	</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Following the same sector
	obstacle rule, enemy sectors can be reinforced from adjacent enemy
	sectors. If an adjacent enemy sector has extra ships available, it
	will send them to help out the sector being attacked. They will fill
	in from that border of the map, too. </SPAN></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Sector Attacks:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
	If an enemy sector has extra ships, it will attack an adjacent USFP
	sector. If the USFP sector is not reinforced by a bridge crew in
	time, the sector is lost to enemies, and needs to be captured again.
	</SPAN></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Crew Registration:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
	A captains registers a ship, and the crew signs on with that ship.
	Crew members can serve on other ships, too. Captains sign up for
	campaigns. </SPAN></FONT>
